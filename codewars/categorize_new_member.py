# The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories
# of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your
# help with an application form that will tell prospective
# members which category they will be placed.

# To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old
# and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club,
# handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the
# lower the handicap.

# Input

# Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items
# each. Each list contains information for a single potential
# member. Information consists of an integer for the person's
# age and an integer for the person's handicap.

# Example Input

# [[18, 20],[45, 2],[61, 12],[37, 6],[21, 21],[78, 9]]
# Output

# Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell: Open or Senior)
# stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

# Example Output

# ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]
